# Introduction  
This is the final project for CSE461.  
Team Members: Cosmo Wang, Xinyi Wang.  
This is a web search engine for “Monster Hunter: World” (MHW)  that lets user search for monsters, items, skills, weapons and armors to get all kinds of information they need for playing the game. 

# How to Launch the Program
Clone the repo on your machine or UW CSE Attu server. Inside the repo directory, type `javac Server.java` to compile the project.  
To launch the program, type `java Server <portnum>`. After launching, the server address will be printed in the console. For example, if you launched the server on attuN with port 2387, you will see `attuN@cs.washington.edu:2387` printed in the console and you can access the web interface by copying the url into any browser.  
To shut down the program, press ctrl + c in the console.
